# First Mile Capital — AI Admin Platform

## Owner
Morris Zeitouni (mz@firstmilecap.com) — Managing Partner, First Mile Capital

## What This Is
An internal admin dashboard for First Mile Capital, a real estate investment firm. The app is hosted at admin.firstmilecap.com (GitHub Pages) and uses Supabase as the backend + Claude as an AI assistant embedded in the UI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Single-page HTML/JS app (index.html = main admin dashboard, exec.html = executive view)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth)
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic) — embedded chat widget with tool use
- **Email:** Microsoft Graph API via Supabase Edge Functions (aiassistant@firstmilecap.com)
- **SMS:** Telnyx API via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (CNAME: admin.firstmilecap.com)
- **Auth/Identity:** Azure AD (tenant: bb09c9a4-2028-4b30-bdbc-dc9c623a2398, app: 3a5ad401-67c5-4632-993f-2b4051bd6bf1) — DO NOT put secrets here; they live in config.js which is gitignored

## Key Files
- `config.js` — API keys and secrets (gitignored, never commit)
- `index.html` — Main admin dashboard with Claude chat widget and tools
- `exec.html` — Executive dashboard view (standalone, can be opened separately)
- `exec-v2.js` — Executive dashboard native module (ported from exec.html, integrated into index.html iframe). Uses window.supaFetch/window.supaWrite from parent and window.bgtData for NOI. Called via `window.exec2Init()` when navigating to exec view in main app.
- `supabase/functions/send-email/` — Sends email via Microsoft Graph API
- `supabase/functions/sync-inbox/` — Syncs inbox from Graph API to Supabase
- `supabase/functions/send-sms/` — Sends SMS via Telnyx
- `supabase/functions/receive-sms/` — Receives inbound SMS via Telnyx webhook
- `supabase/migrations/` — Database schema (emails, SMS, etc.)
- `data/` — SQL scripts, GL mappings, budget data, accounting calendar
- `batches/` — Budget batch upload data
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts (Google Sheets push, local server)

## Supabase Project
- URL: https://qrtleqasnhbnruodlgpt.supabase.co
- Edge Functions are deployed via `supabase functions deploy <name>`

## Claude Chat Tools (in index.html)
The embedded Claude chat has access to these tools:
- **send_email** — Send email from aiassistant@firstmilecap.com (to, cc, subject, body)
- **search_emails** — Query synced emails via PostgREST or full-text search
- **sync_inbox** — Trigger inbox sync to pull latest emails from Graph API
- (Plus other tools for properties, budgets, GL accounts, etc.)

## Executive Dashboard Architecture (exec-v2.js)
- **Module:** `exec-v2.js` is a standalone IIFE that ports ALL functionality from exec.html into a native module scoped to `#exec2Root`
- **Integration:** index.html loads `<script src="exec-v2.js"></script>` and calls `window.exec2Init()` when switching to exec view
- **Supabase access:** Uses `window.supaFetch(table, query)` and `window.supaWrite(table, method, body, query)` exposed by index.html (no local Supabase config)
- **NOI data:** Reads from `window.bgtData` (populated by index.html's budget module) instead of listening for postMessage
- **CSS scoping:** All CSS selectors prefixed with `#exec2Root` to avoid conflicts with index.html styles; global CSS variables (:root) remain unscoped
- **HTML injection:** Creates full dashboard layout (except header) via innerHTML of #exec2Root element
- **Functions exported:** All dashboard functions are global (e.g., openDrilldown, updateCategory, setCfMode) and callable from onclick handlers
- **Features ported:** Categorization, period computation, drilldowns, chart rendering, balance sheet (investments/liabilities/cash), upload system, pattern learning, investment/liability CRUD, modal dialogs, toast notifications
- **Status:** Partially implemented (core architecture complete, functions stubbed for full implementation)

## Current Work / Status
- **Email integration:** WORKING. Azure AD app registered, Graph API permissions granted (Mail.Read, Mail.Send, Mail.ReadWrite) with admin consent. Edge functions deployed. Send confirmed working 2026-03-27.
- **SMS integration:** WORKING. Telnyx send/receive deployed. Auto-reply via Claude on inbound texts + email forwarding to Morris. Deploy with `--no-verify-jwt` (Telnyx webhook has no auth header).
- **Budget system:** Batch upload system for property budgets, GL account mapping.
- **Calendars & Tasks:** WORKING (renamed from "Accounting Calendar" 2026-04-13). ~53 tasks across 6 properties (PMA-derived, JV OA-derived, lender reporting). All task descriptions cite agreement section references (e.g. "per PMA §4a", "per JV OA §9.2"). Team categorization with multi-team support (comma-separated in DB). Team filter bar + property + type filters. Default filter auto-selects logged-in user's team. Task table below calendar with Recurring/One-Time toggle, inline edit/delete. Dynamic CRUD modal: cadence-first flow (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual/One-Time), multi-team chip picker, long-text description/notes field. One-time tasks have specific due dates. Annual tasks filtered by `due_month` column. Terminate action (soft-delete) + Delete action available on all tasks. Year navigation (2026, 2027+). Day overflow: tasks with day > daysInMonth render on last calendar day.
- **Task Reminder Emails:** Edge function `task-reminders` sends automated deadline emails to team members. Three modes:
  - `upcoming` — runs daily at 8 AM ET (cron `0 12 * * *`), emails team members about tasks due TOMORROW
  - `pastdue` — runs daily at 8 AM ET (cron `0 12 * * *`), emails team members about tasks that were due YESTERDAY and not marked Done
  - `escalation` — runs daily at 8 AM ET (cron `0 12 * * *`), emails Morris + Rasheq a summary of ALL tasks 2+ days past due across ALL teams. Grouped by team → property. Shows days late with color-coded urgency (2-3d yellow, 4-6d orange, 7d+ red). Scans last 30 days.
  - Recipients determined by task's team assignment → team roster from `app_users` table. One email per person (multiple tasks consolidated). Falls back to Executive team if no team members found.
  - Emails include: property, type, task description in a table. Footer tells recipients to reply to the email or use the dashboard link to mark tasks complete.
  - Edge function: `supabase/functions/task-reminders/index.ts`. Deploy: `supabase functions deploy task-reminders --no-verify-jwt`
  - pg_cron jobs: `task-reminders-upcoming`, `task-reminders-pastdue`, and `task-reminders-escalation`, all visible on Manage > Scheduled Jobs page
  - Task completion via email reply: when a team member replies to a reminder email listing completed tasks, the auto-reply system (or Claude chat) should parse and mark those tasks as Done
- **Executive Dashboard (exec-v2.js):** PRIMARY MODULE as of 2026-03-30. Renamed from "Exec Financials v2" to "Executive Financials". Old exec.html iframe hidden in sidebar (data-view="exec", display:none). Home module card links to exec2. Core features working: balance sheet, P&L, chart with hover tooltips, transaction upload, investment/liability CRUD, property photos on cards. Remaining work: complete pattern learning, complete transaction review panel.

## Quarterly Financial Report
- **What:** Quarterly email + PDF to Morris summarizing YTD financials — net position, net income, cash flow, P&L breakdown, balance sheet, investments, and narrative highlights (positives + areas to watch)
- **PDF:** Generated via `scripts/build_monthly_digest.py` using reportlab — 3 pages: executive summary + P&L, balance sheet + cash flow, footer. Named `First_Mile_Capital_Q1_2026_Report.pdf` etc.
- **Email:** Sent via send-email edge function. To: mz@firstmilecap.com, CC: rc@firstmilecap.com, ty@firstmilecap.com, src@cacq.com. Body is FULL HTML report (not just summary) — tables for KPI metrics, P&L, balance sheet, cash, investments, liabilities, cash flow, loans. PDF also attached.
- **Email format:** Morris wants the email body to be the full report embedded as HTML (like a PDF rendered in email), NOT a short summary with just highlights. Always include all tables and sections.
- **CC recipients:** send-email edge function `cc` field must be an ARRAY of strings, not comma-separated (Graph API rejects comma-separated).
- **Timing:** Run after Morris closes the books each quarter (Q1–Q4). Not on a fixed schedule — triggered manually or via scheduled task.
- **Output:** Saved to `~/First Mile Dropbox/Morris Zeitouni/FM Quarterly Reports/` (falls back to `reports/` in workspace). `reports/` is gitignored.
- **Attachment support:** send-email edge function accepts `attachments` array (each: `{name, contentType, contentBytes}` where contentBytes is base64).
- **Sent:** 2026-03-29 Q1 report sent to all 4 executives (Morris, Ricky, Toby, Stanley) with full HTML body + PDF attachment.
- **Cash note:** ~$4M in SAVINGS account is investor capital held for deployment (Six Fields/Lifetime AZ loan), NOT discretionary FM cash. Operating cash is only ~$346K. Report asterisks the $4M in both PDF and email.
- **Terminology:** Use "Total Revenue" (not "Total Income") everywhere — only "Net Income" uses the word "income". Applied to PDF, email, and exec.html dashboard.
- **NOI dependency:** Balance sheet investment valuations depend on NOI data from budget module. exec.html now waits for NOI before showing net position (no more flash of wrong -$4M number).

## Bank Transaction Upload System (CSV)
- **Upload button** in exec.html header ("📤 Upload Transactions") opens upload modal
- **CSV format:** Chase BAI2 format — columns: As Of, Currency, BankID Type, BankID, Account, Data Type, BAI Code, Description, Amount, Balance/Value Date, Customer Reference, Immediate Availability, 1 Day Float, 2+ DayFloat, Bank Reference, Text
- **Deduplication:** Checks date + amount + first 40 chars of description against existing allRecords. Also dedupes within the upload file itself. Since Morris uploads 30-day rolling views weekly, overlap is expected and handled.
- **Confidence scoring:** `categorizeWithConfidence()` wraps the existing `categorize()` function and adds confidence levels:
  - **High:** Known patterns (JUSTWORK=Payroll, CORPORATION SERV=Legal, SIGONFILE=Investment Income, NYS DTF/NJ WEB PMT=Taxes, SETTLEMENT=Owner Distributions, ACCOUNT TRANSFER=Internal Transfer, etc.) + Member account credits/debits + Management account Appfolio deposits
  - **Medium:** Auto-rule match that isn't generic
  - **Low:** Falls into generic catch-all categories (Other Income, Other Operating, Wire Payments, etc.)
- **Review screen:** Two sections — "Needs Review" (low/medium confidence, sorted by amount) at top, "High Confidence Matches" (high confidence, sorted by date) at bottom
- **Income linking dropdowns:** AM Fee, PM Fee, Dev Fee, Acquisition Fee get a **Property dropdown** to link income to specific properties. Investment Income gets an **Investment dropdown** (same as Investment Contributions). Interest Expense gets a **Liability dropdown** to link to loans.
- **These linking dropdowns also work in existing drilldowns** — not just the upload review screen
- **Pattern learning:** `exec_learned_patterns` table stores description patterns from user categorizations. Confidence and occurrence counts improve over time. On each upload confirmation, patterns are extracted from user's category choices and saved/incremented.
- **DB columns added:** `property_id TEXT` and `liability_id UUID` on exec_transactions. New table `exec_learned_patterns`.
- **CSV files stored in:** `Bank Transactions Batch Upload/` folder (gitignored)
- **Debits:** CSV shows debit amounts as positive — the upload code negates them (amount = -Math.abs(rawAmount) for Debits)
- **Account mapping:** ACCOUNT_NAME_MAP in exec.html maps account numbers to names (includes Pref Fund I: 483103381654, etc.)

## Active Initiatives Module
- **What:** Project tracking module for special projects, deal activity, and communications. Built 2026-04-15.
- **Module name:** "Active Initiatives" (sidebar + home card)
- **Files:** `initiatives.js` (external IIFE module, same pattern as exec-v2.js), view container in index.html `#view-initiatives` → `#initRoot`
- **DB Tables:** `initiatives` (main project), `initiative_members` (visibility/team), `initiative_entries` (chronological log: emails, notes, milestones, tasks, documents)
- **Visibility:** Per-project membership. Only users whose email is in `initiative_members` for a given initiative can see it. Admins (`isAdmin=true`) see all. The sidebar item is visible to all users.
- **Features:** Project cards grid with status filters (All/Active/On Hold/Completed), detail view with 3 tabs (Activity timeline, Milestones with checkboxes, Team members with roles), CRUD modals for creating/editing initiatives and adding entries/milestones/members
- **Entry types:** email (linked from inbox with from/to/cc metadata), note, milestone (with due_date + completed toggle), task (with assignee + due_date), document
- **Team roles:** owner, member, viewer — stored in `initiative_members.role`
- **Seeded test project:** "41 Flatbush — Gimlet/Spotify Lease Buyout" with 26 emails from the RC/AI thread, 3 milestones, 1 pinned note. Members: rc@ (owner), mz@ (member), aiassistant@ (member)
- **Design intent (from Morris):** When someone emails AI assistant a project question, Claude should use judgment: create a new initiative if it's a real project, add to an existing one if it's a continuation, or just reply if it's a simple question. Only email recipients (to/cc) should be added as members.
- **CRITICAL: Always reply to emails.** When Morris (or anyone) emails the AI assistant with a task like "create a new initiative", Claude MUST send a confirmation reply email acknowledging receipt, summarizing what was created, and linking to the dashboard. Never leave an email unanswered.
- **Overview tab:** Default landing when opening a project. Layout order: (1) AI Summary narrative, (2) Key deal visual/table specific to the project goal (stored as entry with `content='key_metrics'` and `metadata.type='deal_table'`), (3) compact stat chips, (4) milestones + key context side-by-side, (5) activity timeline. The deal table should reflect the core decision the project is driving toward — e.g. buyout offer scenarios for Gimlet, ask-vs-target comparison for acquisitions.
- **Access:** Module is visible to all users (no `access_initiatives` column). Data-level visibility controlled by `initiative_members` — non-admins only see initiatives they're members of.
- **`window.currentUser` exposure:** Added `Object.defineProperty` getter on `window` to expose the closure-scoped `currentUser` variable to external modules. Uses `isAdmin` (camelCase, not `is_admin`).
- **Supabase Storage:** `initiative-docs` bucket (public, full CRUD policies). Files stored at `{initiative-id-prefix}/{timestamp}_{filename}`. Public URL pattern: `https://qrtleqasnhbnruodlgpt.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/initiative-docs/{path}`. Upload via Docs tab drag-and-drop or API.
- **Auto-store behavior (CRITICAL):** When an email thread is forwarded to AI assistant to create an initiative, Claude MUST: (1) Create the initiative with a thoughtful summary, (2) Add all email participants as members, (3) Store any attached documents as `document` entries with Supabase Storage URLs (fetch from Graph API if possible), (4) Create a **project-specific deal table** (`content='key_metrics'`, `metadata.type='deal_table'`) that reflects the core decision the project is driving toward — NOT a generic table, (5) Add milestones with realistic due dates, (6) Reply to the email confirming everything. For the deal table, use judgment: buyout scenarios for lease negotiations, ask-vs-target for acquisitions, key terms table for vendor agreements, etc.
- **CRITICAL — Key Deal Visual must be project-specific and decision-relevant (Morris 2026-04-17):** The key_metrics deal_table at the top of the Overview page is NOT a generic info card. Claude must reason about what decision the project is driving toward and build a visual that surfaces the numbers needed to make that call. Use the full matrix format: `metadata.columns`, `metadata.rows` (2D array), optional `metadata.highlight_row` (0-indexed), and `metadata.summary_stats` (array of {value,label} chips). Example triggers:
  - **Prospective acquisition / underwriting stage** → Return sensitivity grid: rows = scenarios (Downside/Base/Upside), columns = Purchase Price, $/SF, Entry Cap, Stabilized NOI, Stab. YoC, Equity Check, Exit Value, Levered IRR, MOIC. Highlight the Base Case row.
  - **Lease buyout negotiation** → Offer scenario table: rows = offer amounts, columns = NPV savings vs. holding, remaining lease obligation, effective discount %, counterparty reaction.
  - **Vendor / construction contract** → Key terms table: scope, price, milestones, fee %, termination rights.
  - **Lease-up / leasing campaign** → Pipeline pivot: tenant × stage × SF × rent × probability.
  - Always include `summary_stats` chips for 4-5 headline numbers (NOI, debt, occupancy, anchor tenant, etc.)
- **Migration files:** `migration/create-initiatives.sql` (original schema); `migration/add-initiative-categories.sql` (2026-04-17: adds `category` column + `stale` status).
- **Categorization (added 2026-04-17):** Every initiative has a `category` column with values `prospective_investment` (a deal we may close) or `general` (default). Status CHECK extended to include `stale` (dead/passed deal). List view is grouped into 3 collapsible sections in this order: **Prospective Investments — Active**, **Prospective Investments — Stale / Not Closed** (collapsed by default), **General Initiatives**. Section filter buttons include an explicit "Stale" filter. Detail header shows a quick-action button for prospective investments: "⏸️ Mark Stale" when active, "↻ Reactivate" when stale. Category is selectable in both Create and Edit modals. When creating/importing a prospective deal (e.g. from Dropbox `1.1 Projects - Prospective`), always set `category='prospective_investment'`.
- **650 Madison Avenue initiative (added 2026-04-17):** id `b5a99b78-8970-4746-9a9c-022df6d93555`. Prospective acquisition/recap of Vornado's 650 Madison (Plaza District, 588,672 SF). $280M loan at 3.486% transferring to special servicing. 2026B NOI $26.6M (+22.6% YoY). Anchor: Ralph Lauren (204K SF, LXD 4/30/36). Members: mz/rc/ty. Deal table is a 3-scenario UW return sensitivity with Base highlighted. Source docs (UW model, 2026 budget, CF shortfall model, Moncler RCD, lease expirations) in Dropbox `1.1 Projects - Prospective/650 Madison`.
- **1 & 25 Deforest Ave initiative (added 2026-04-17):** id `b2544868-1b3e-4548-9012-cc4982cbc731`. Prospective acquisition — two-building Class A office campus in Summit, NJ totaling ~287,400 SF.

Milestones: Tour 4/24, UW v2 5/1, LOI 5/8, PSA 5/29, diligence 6/30, financing 8/1, close 8/15. 11 document entries reference files in Dropbox `1.1 Projects - Prospective/1 & 25 Deforest Ave Summit, NJ/` (UW xlsx, JLL OM, Argus, rent rolls, 2025 ops stmts, CAM/tax recoveries, leases, surveys, BOMA).
- **200 Greenwich Ave initiative:** id `7e9da281-b488-40d1-9f4a-6ea42b91dddf`. Re-categorized as `prospective_investment` 2026-04-17.
- **Webster Bank Notes initiative (added 2026-04-23):** Category `prospective_investment`. Note-to-own play on 3 senior mortgage notes originated by Webster Bank. Thesis: bid notes at a discount; if performing, earn discount accretion + contract rate; if default, foreclose and own the property at cost basis below replacement. **3 deals:** (1) **9 Campus Drive, Parsippany NJ** — suburban office ~200K SF, anchor Securitas 85K SF thru 8/31/2031 (53% of revenue), T12 revenue $3.08M, near-term rolls on Agadia 12,944 SF (Jan 2026) + Safety Sells 6,732 SF (Aug 2025). (2) **955 Mass Ave, Cambridge MA** — mixed-use Harvard Square adjacent, tenants Salesforce/Mathematica/Dado Tea (X4 Pharma terminated). Financial data in PDFs only — need pypdf re-scan. (3) **4300 Roosevelt Commons, Seattle WA** — two-building 229K SF campus. **Loan: $62.8M @ 2.996% fixed (with derivative), matures 12/12/2029.** 2024 NOI $7.83M, debt service $1.91M, DSCR 4.1x. 2025 lease roll risk (UW Regents 68K SF exp 1/31/25, Seattle CHOP 67K SF exp 8/31/25); Oct-24 model projects post-roll NOI $4.9M/yr (still 2.6x DSCR). Members: mz (owner), rc, ty, aiassistant. Seed SQL at `migration/seed-webster-bank-notes.sql`. Deal matrix highlights 4300 Roosevelt (only deal with confirmed loan data). **Open data needs from Webster:** UPB per note, asking price / discount, stated rate + amortization for 9 Campus and 955 Mass Ave. Scanner at `scripts/scan_prospective_deals.py` can be re-run with `pypdf` installed to extract PDF financials.
- **Red Bank / River Centre — Paramount Partner Buyout initiative (added 2026-04-20):** id `6c7f22b5-7463-4522-9cef-6f0da74218d3`. Category `general` (existing asset, not prospective acquisition). Morris wants to buy out JV partner Paramount Realty's 30% membership / 26.25% capital contribution stake in FM Paramount JV LLC. Asset = 658,928 SF 5-building Class A office campus: 331 Newman Springs Dr + 100 & 200 Schulz Dr, Red Bank, NJ. **Capital stack:** $40M equity ($29.5M FM / $10.5M Paramount) + $88M debt (UBS CMBS $55M @ 7.985% matures 10/6/2028; Webster Bank NVA loan $34M @ SOFR+200 ~6.42% matures 5/10/2031). Distributions to Paramount to date: $0. **NOI path:** 2025 actual $10.8M → 2026 budget $10.04M → 2027 budget $12.59M (88% occ) → stabilized target $14.1M with ~56K SF remaining vacancy leased up. **Lease-up drivers:** Hackensack 52K SF (River 3 Ste 101+202, rent 1/2027 after 6 mo free from 7/2026), Paramount 15K SF (River 3 Ste 331 portion, starts 7/2026), Zipp Law 6,790 SF (River 2 Ste 310, 7/2026), Inflexion 8,863 SF (River 3 Ste 201, 3/2026), Withum 25,306 SF vacating 9/2026 needing backfill, GFI/BGC 19,428 SF at 50% rent through 4/2027. **Ownership structure:** FM Red Member LLC (Richard Chera managing, 42% promote) → 5% of FM Red JV LLC; Investor Members own 95% of FM Red JV; FM Red JV owns 70% of FM Paramount JV LLC; Paramount River Centre LLC (Maurice Zekaria via Paramount Realty Fund V LP) owns the 30%. **Strategic angles:** NJ mansion-tax asymmetry (Paramount buying us pays more because transferring >50%), 2.5% of gross fee stream capture, avoids ~4% brokerage/transfer friction on a full sale. **Sale scenarios** (per River Center Sale Scenario.xlsx): stabilized $13M NOI → gross $162.5-185.7M, net proceeds $86.75-109.96M after $88M debt + Avalon sale ($18.75M) - capex/stabilization costs ($23.25M) → Paramount 26.25% share $22.8-28.9M. **Capital events (2026 one-time):** Avalon Bay sale +$18.75M proceeds, partner loan repayments -$2M (Zekaria) -$500K (Chera). Deal table is buyout valuation matrix highlighting Stabilized Base scenario. Members: mz (owner), rc, ty, aiassistant. **Cash flow model** at Dropbox `2.1 FMC Property Management/Red Bank - 1 River Centre/First Mille Buyout - 2026/First MIle - Buyout analysis.xlsx` — 6-year projection (2026-2031) with tenant-by-tenant base rent (outline-grouped by building for collapse/expand), per-suite vacancy lease-up with market rent/free-rent/start-date modeling, recoveries as base-year PSF × occupied SF × OpEx inflation, dual-loan amort schedules with UBS refi event at 10/2028, leasing costs broken out by space (Committed/Backfills/Speculative/Capex), Avalon + partner loan section, and Year-6 exit value block. 352 formulas, 0 errors. Sheet1 (original Costs to Stabilize) preserved.

## Monthly Actuals Sync (Property Financials)
- **What:** Monthly workflow to pull property P&L actuals from Dropbox and populate Supabase `actuals_line_items`. Added 2026-04-22.
- **Script:** `scripts/sync_actuals.py`. Run on Morris's Mac (has Dropbox mount): `python3 scripts/sync_actuals.py --commit`
- **Flow:** Walks `~/First Mile Dropbox/.../2.1 FMC Property Management/<Property>/4 - Accounting/A - Month Quarter Financials/`, finds the latest `12Monthsincomestatement_pXXXXX_*.xlsx` per property, materializes it (Dropbox online-only files download on first read via macOS File Provider), parses the Yardi 12-month P&L, maps account names → GL codes, and upserts by DELETE+INSERT for (property_id, year).
- **Default year gate:** Only processes year ≥ 2026 (2025 COA uses legacy aliases and needs separate name→GL mapping). Override with `--min-year 2025` when backfilling.
- **Dry-run by default.** Add `--commit` to actually write. `--property p0000003` or `--file path/to.xlsx` for targeted runs. `--verbose` for per-line dump.
- **Property code map (Yardi pXXXXXXX → Airtable rec ID stored in DB):** p0000003 → recQX1kpeJKqIzvkU (Paramus Plaza), p0000004 → recUUsUChvL3yQ96g (340 Mount Kemble), p0000005 → **recqfxJfdqCXCLOuD** (61 S Paramus), p0000006 → recxF4R64gbb5Sowj (575 Broadway), p0000007 → recF3zFKbY4wJ4P40 (1700 East Putnam). **CRITICAL: the DB column `property_id` stores the Airtable rec ID, NOT the Yardi `pXXX` code.** Any seed SQL or query against `rent_roll`, `releasing_profiles`, `budget_line_items`, `actuals_line_items`, etc. MUST use the Airtable rec ID. The `pXXX` codes only exist as labels inside the sync scripts' `PROPERTY_MAP` / `FOLDER_TO_PROPERTY` dicts. Canonical mapping lives at `scripts/sync_rent_rolls.py` lines 71–86. Metropolitan properties aren't in Yardi (passive); add to `PROPERTY_MAP` when they are.
- **Name overrides:** See `NAME_OVERRIDES` in the script for Yardi-name → GL-code aliases (e.g. "Property Tax" → 6512). 2026 files should use consistent COA so overrides are mostly unused, but kept as a safety net. `SKIP_PATTERNS` filter out intermediate Yardi sub-totals (e.g. "TOTAL R&M - OUTDOOR") that don't belong to our COA.
- **Dropbox Online-Only support:** Script calls `materialize_dropbox_file()` which reads a few bytes to trigger the macOS File Provider extension — pulls the file from Dropbox if it's a placeholder, then polls until size stabilizes. No manual click needed.
- **Property Financials — Summary column blending:** The '26 Actuals column on the Summary tab now blends YTD actuals + ROY budget for the active year. Column label becomes `'26 Act thru <Month> + Bgt` when partial. "Closed months" are determined by presence of non-zero values in sentinel rows (TOTAL INCOME, NOI, TOTAL BUILDING EXPENSES, TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES). Pre-active years show pure actuals; planning years show pure budget; active year with no actuals loaded shows dashes.
- **Property Financials — Status-aware tab bar (2026-04-22):** Tabs in the Property Financials detail panel now change based on the selected year's status:
  - **Active year** (e.g. 2026): `Overview | P&L | Monthly Trend | Drilldown | Balance Sheet`. Lands on Overview by default.
  - **Planning year** (e.g. 2027): `Budget | Drilldown | Balance Sheet`. Lands on Budget.
  - **Historical year** (e.g. 2025): `Actuals | Variance Story | Balance Sheet`. Lands on Variance Story.
  - Tab config lives in `FB_TABS_BY_STATUS` + `FB_DEFAULT_TAB`. Rebuilt dynamically by `fbUpdateNavForYear()`. Legacy tab ids (`summary`, `revenue`, `opex`, `capital`, `monthly`) still route correctly via a fallback in `fbRenderDetail()`.
- **Property Financials — Overview tab (active year):** New default landing. Shows:
  - 4 KPI cards (Revenue, OpEx, NOI, Occupancy) with YTD value + variance chip + FY forecast (YTD Act + ROY Bgt) vs FY Budget. Occupancy card is stubbed pending rent-roll data source.
  - Cumulative YTD NOI chart (SVG): solid cyan actuals line through the last closed month, solid green budget line for the full year, dashed grey forecast continuation.
  - Top 5 favorable + top 5 unfavorable variance leaderboards (YTD, ranked by abs $ impact). Income lines treat over-budget as favorable; expense lines treat under-budget as favorable.
  - Closed-months indicator (12 tiny letter boxes, green if closed).
- **Property Financials — Consolidated Drilldown tab:** Replaces the 3 separate Revenue / OpEx / Capital tabs with a single `Drilldown` tab and a segmented switcher at the top. Reuses existing `fbRenderMonthlyDetail()` internals.
- **Property Financials — Variance Story tab (historical year):** Variance leaderboard (same component as Overview) plus a 3-KPI year recap card (Revenue / OpEx / NOI actuals with % vs budget).
- **Property Financials — Monthly Act vs Bgt tab:** Renamed `Monthly Trend`. Only visible for the active year. Renders GL-line rows (budget skeleton) with Actual / Budget / Var$ columns for each month (default) or each quarter (toggle). Also shows full-year total column. Respects $/PSF mode. When no actuals exist for the year, displays a banner suggesting the sync command.
- **Data load split:** `index.html` now tags `budget_line_items` rows with `_source='budget'` and `actuals_line_items` rows with `_source='actuals'`, then builds separate budget/actuals year-data sub-objects so they can coexist for the active year without double-counting. Each `bgtData[i].years[yr]` has `.budget` and `.actuals` sub-objects plus a flattened canonical shape for backward compat with other tabs.

## Rent Roll System (2026-04-22)
- **What:** Live snapshot of tenant leases per property in Supabase `rent_roll` table. Drives the new Rent Roll tab on Property Financials + the Occupancy KPI on the Overview tab + auto-revenue-budget generation for Planning years.
- **Schema:** `migration/create-rent-roll.sql` — one row per tenant×suite with tenant name, suite, status, SF, lease dates, monthly/annual rent, rent/SF, escalation structure (type, pct, months, next bump date), recovery structure (CAM/RE tax/insurance), free rent, renewal options, notes, source_file. Indexes on property_id + (property_id, status) + (property_id, lease_end). View `rent_roll_active` filters to Current/Pending leases.
- **Sync script:** `scripts/sync_rent_rolls.py`. Same pattern as sync_actuals.py: walks Dropbox property folders (preferring `3 - Operations/`, `2 - Leasing_Marketing/`, `4 - Accounting/`), finds the latest `Rent Roll*.xlsx` / `RR*.xlsx`, materializes online-only files, parses with fuzzy header matching (see `COLUMN_ALIASES`), DELETE+INSERT upsert per property. Dry-run by default; `--commit` to write. `--property p0000003` or `--file path.xlsx` for targeted runs.
- **Rent Roll tab:** Visible on all year statuses (active/planning/historical). Shows 4 KPI cards (Occupancy, Annual Base Rent in-place, Active Leases, Expiring ≤12mo), filter chips (All/Current/Expiring/Vacant), and a wide tenant table with Tenant, Suite, Status, SF, Rent/SF, Monthly Rent, Annual Rent, Lease Start/End, Escalation, Next Bump. Rows expiring within 12 months are colored red.
- **Auto-Generate Revenue Budget (Planning year only):** Button on the Rent Roll tab for Planning years. Projects each tenant's base rent forward month-by-month across the target year, applies contractual escalations at `next_escalation_date` intervals (using `escalation_pct` + `escalation_months`), drops expiring leases to $0 (conservative), sums tenants to get monthly revenue totals, DELETE+INSERT to `budget_line_items` with gl_code='4010' (Base Rent - Contractual). Confirm dialog before destructive write. Requires page reload to see on Budget tab.
- **Overview Occupancy KPI:** Now wired to rent_roll. `fbPopulateOccupancyKPI` fetches the rent roll async (after the rest of Overview renders) and computes % = sum(active lease SF) / property SF. Cached in `fbRentRollCache` to avoid refetching.
- **Property code map:** Same mapping as sync_actuals.py (p0000003→Paramus Plaza, etc.). Metropolitan properties not in Yardi yet — add to FOLDER_TO_PROPERTY when they come online.
- **To enable:** (1) Run `migration/create-rent-roll.sql` in admin SQL Console. (2) Drop rent rolls in Dropbox property folders. (3) Run `python3 scripts/sync_rent_rolls.py --commit`. (4) Navigate to any Planning year → Rent Roll tab → click Generate Revenue Budget.
- **Period banner (2026-05-05):** Top of the Rent Roll tab now shows "Period: <Month Year>" pulled from a new `as_of_date` column on `rent_roll` (Yardi exports include an "As of Date:" header that `sync_rent_rolls.py` parses; generic-format files fall back to file mtime). Mirrors the Balance Sheet tab's period label. Shows source filename + last-synced date alongside the period. Migration: `migration/add-rent-roll-as-of.sql` (adds nullable `as_of_date DATE` + index).

## Re-Leasing Profiles (Rent Roll tab, 2026-05-05)
- **What:** Underwriting assumptions for what happens when an existing lease rolls. Each profile defines a "new lease" path (don't renew, re-let to a new tenant) and a "renewal" path (existing tenant stays), with a renewal probability that drives a probability-weighted **blended** value for each assumption. Used to feed lease-up modeling into the rent-roll-driven revenue budget and (eventually) the cash forecast.
- **Schema:** `migration/create-releasing-profiles.sql` — table `releasing_profiles` with columns: `property_id`, `name`, `is_default`, `renewal_probability_pct` (0–100), `base_rent_psf` (single value, no new/renew split), then `new_*` and `renew_*` pairs for each of `downtime_months`, `free_rent_months`, `escalation_pct`, `ti_psf`, `lc_pct`. Unique partial index `uq_releasing_profiles_default` enforces at most one default profile per property.
- **Field semantics:**
  - `downtime_months` = months the suite sits vacant after the prior lease ends, before the new tenant takes occupancy.
  - `free_rent_months` = months tenant occupies but pays $0 (concession period).
  - `escalation_pct` = annual contractual rent bump.
  - `ti_psf` = Tenant Improvement allowance, capex paid at lease commencement (= ti_psf × suite SF).
  - `lc_pct` = Leasing Commission, % of the **full deal rent (base rent × term length)** paid at signing. Both new and renewal columns supported.
- **Blending math (computed in UI, not stored):** `blended = (renewal_pct/100) × renew_<x> + (1 − renewal_pct/100) × new_<x>` for each of the 5 levers. Base rent has no blend (single value). Empty inputs treated as 0 in blend so partial profiles still compute.
- **UI — profile cards & modal:** Section at the bottom of the Rent Roll tab shows profile cards with name, renewal probability, base rent chip, and a 4-column mini-table (Assumption · New · Renewal · Blended). "+ New Profile" button opens a modal with three-column input grid (New Lease · Renewal · Blended) — Blended cells update **live** as you type via `fbRecalcBlended()`. Save / Edit / Delete CRUD via `supaWrite` against `releasing_profiles`. Cache: `fbReleasingProfilesCache[propId]`.
- **Per-tenant assignment (2026-05-05):** Each row in the rent-roll table now has a "Re-Leasing Profile" `<select>` cell at the right edge. Selecting a profile sets `rent_roll.releasing_profile_id` (PATCH via `fbSetTenantProfile`). Migration: `migration/add-rent-roll-profile.sql` (adds nullable `releasing_profile_id UUID` + index).
- **Projection in `fbAutoBuildRevenueBudget`:** When a tenant has a profile assigned, the auto-generated revenue budget no longer drops to $0 at `lease_end`. Instead it: (1) holds $0 for `Math.ceil(blended downtime)` months of vacancy, (2) holds $0 for `Math.ceil(blended free rent)` months of free rent, (3) resumes at `base_rent_psf × sf / 12` per month, (4) compounds blended `escalation_pct` annually thereafter. Tenants without a profile keep the conservative $0-after-lease-end behavior.
- **Default profile:** When `is_default=true` is set in the modal, the save handler first PATCHes any other rows for the same property to `is_default=false` to satisfy the unique partial index, then writes the new/edited row.
- **To enable:** Run `migration/create-releasing-profiles.sql` then `migration/add-rent-roll-profile.sql` in the SQL Console. The Rent Roll tab silently shows a "table not found" hint and hides the dropdown column until both migrations run.
- **Future hook:** Cash Forecast assumptions panel should pull the assigned-or-default re-leasing profile to model lease rollover (TI/LC capex events at lease commencement, vacancy-driven NOI dip during downtime). Not wired yet.

## Cash Forecast (Property Financials, 2026-04-22)
- **What:** New `Cash Forecast` tab on Property Financials for Active + Planning years. 12-month rolling forecast of operating cash balance + reserve balance. Added 2026-04-22.
- **Tab placement:** Between Rent Roll and Balance Sheet on Active and Planning year tab bars. Not shown on Historical.
- **Layout:** (1) 4 KPI cards — Property Cash Today · 12-Mo Projected End Cash · Lowest Operating Cash (+ when) · Reserve Balance (12-Mo). (2) SVG combo chart with monthly bars (green=operating inflow, yellow stacked=reserve draw offsetting capex, red=outflows below baseline), cyan line for cumulative operating cash, amber dashed line for reserve balance. (3) Monthly breakdown table grouped by Operating Inflows / Operating Outflows / Levered Cash Flow / Capital Events. (4) Assumptions panel showing data-source status (✓ linked / not loaded).
- **Data sources (5):**
  - `rent_roll` → Base Rent per month (with contractual escalations applied at `next_escalation_date`)
  - `budget_line_items` → Expense Recoveries (GL 41xx), Other Income (GL 45xx/47xx/48xx), Operating Expenses (GL 5xxx + 65xx)
  - `exec_liabilities` → Monthly P&I interest computed as `usd_equivalent × interest_rate / 12` (defaults to 6% if rate missing). Matched to property via `related_deal` text contains
  - `reserve_draws` → Positive amounts = draw from reserve to operating; negative amounts = deposit from operating to reserve. Drives yellow stacked segment on chart + reserve balance line
  - `cash_forecast_events` → Manual entries for TI/LC, capex, partner distributions, contributions, reserve_draw, reserve_deposit, other (new table, see migration)
  - `property_cash` → Starting operating + reserve balances (new table, see migration)
- **Schema:** `migration/create-cash-forecast.sql` creates `cash_forecast_events` (property_id, year, month, event_type, amount, description) and `property_cash` (property_id, operating_cash, reserve_cash, notes).
- **Reserve balance line (2nd series):** Amber dashed line tracks reserve balance month-by-month = starting reserve − draws + deposits. Legend updated; min-reserve threshold concept removed per Morris's call.
- **Forecast window:** Rolling 12 months starting from next month (e.g. in Apr 2026 → May 2026 through Apr 2027). Same view whether on Active or Planning year.
- **Editing:** Prompt-based editors for v1 (`fbEditPropertyCash`, `fbEditCashEvents`). v2 will have proper modals. Both invalidate `fbCashForecastCache[propId]` and re-render.
- **Computation:** `fbComputeCashForecast(baseProp, cache)` walks 12 months, applying rent-roll escalations per tenant, summing budget rows by GL prefix, computing monthly debt service, pulling draws/deposits/events by (year, month), returning `{ rows: [12 months], starting, lowest, endingCash, avgLevered }`. Render in `fbBuildCashForecastHTML`.
- **Enable steps:** (1) Run `migration/create-cash-forecast.sql` in admin SQL Console. (2) Optionally set starting cash + monthly events via the Edit buttons on the assumptions panel. (3) Navigate to any property → Cash Forecast tab. Shows warnings if inputs missing.

## Pending / Known Issues
- **132-40 Metropolitan NOI not showing on balance sheet:** Property exists in exec_investments but shows $0 valuation. FB_PROP_META updated in index.html code, but live site needs git push. Also `fbGlAccounts` was null when trying to recompute budget data — GL accounts may not have loaded. Budget rows DO exist in Supabase (confirmed). **UPDATE 2026-03-30:** Budget data (2026+2027) seeded via `migration/seed-metropolitan-budget.sql`. NOI corrected to exclude RET (Real Estate Tax Recovery) pass-throughs: 2026 NOI = $1,124,216 ($93,684.70/mo), 2027 NOI = $1,390,000 ($115,833.33/mo per Morris). RET is tenant reimbursement that offsets RE Tax expense — not real income.
- **Investment contribution → auto-update contributed amount:** When linking a wire to an investment via dropdown, should also increment that investment's `contributed` field. Not yet implemented.
- **~~Investment distributions → auto-update distributed amount~~:** DONE 2026-03-30. When Investment Income transactions are linked to an investment, the `distributed` field on the balance sheet is computed dynamically by summing all linked Investment Income transactions. Updates in real time when linking/unlinking via `recomputeDistributed()`. Distributed = editable base (historical, stored in Supabase `distributed` column) + sum of linked Investment Income transactions. Base is editable via ✏️ pencil on the balance sheet card or the full edit modal.
- **Net Position line chart (quarterly snapshot):** Once quarterly books are officially closed, create a snapshot of balance sheet net position so we can build a line chart tracking net position over time (same style as the existing net income line chart). Needs a DB table for quarterly snapshots (e.g. `exec_quarterly_snapshots` with columns: quarter, year, net_position, total_assets, total_liabilities, net_income, snapshot_date).
- **~~Cash flow chart should show Net Income P&L~~:** DONE 2026-03-30. Chart now shows Net Income (P&L) — revenue bars, opex bars, cumulative net income line. Changed from cash flow which included balance sheet items. Hover tooltips show Revenue, Expenses, and cumulative Net Income per period.
- **Git push from sandbox not possible:** `git push` returns 403 from proxy. Morris pushes from his machine. Always commit locally and remind Morris to push.

## Business Logic & Domain Knowledge
*(Things that live in Morris's head, not in the code — add here as we learn them)*
- Payroll reimbursements are structured as deductions to the property management fee (not separate line items)
- Credits (incoming) to First Mile Management LLC account = Property Management Fee Income, even if they're account transfers. Only outgoing transfers from Management are Internal Transfers.
- ~$4M in FM Capital SAVINGS account is investor capital held for deployment (Six Fields loan for Lifetime AZ) — NOT discretionary FM cash. Will be deployed into an asset soon. Operating cash is only ~$346K across other accounts.
- ReWyre (Rasheq Zarif salary, ~$104K) is an asset on books — salary advance/investment
- Biweekly payroll reimbursement transfers (~$16,287, $20,200, $19,939, $2,011.36) between management and main accounts are categorized as "Payroll Reimbursement" — known amounts in PAYROLL_REIMB_AMOUNTS array with $5 tolerance matching
- AM Partner Payouts (~$4,333/mo from FM Paramus Member account) are deductions against Asset Management Fee Income, not separate distributions — shown as "Less: AM Partner Payout" in the AM Fee drilldown
- Email auto-reply is instant via Graph webhook (email-webhook) with 5-min cron fallback (check-inbox); dedup via atomic `replied_at` lock in auto-reply function
- Graph webhook subscription (subscribe-inbox) expires every 3 days — needs daily cron renewal
- "Deposit" category = balance sheet asset (not operating expense), tracked separately like Loan Out
- "Loan Out" category = balance sheet asset, user assigns a friendly name (e.g. "Wooster loan to Ricky") shown on balance sheet instead of bank description
- JLL CAS credits = Asset Management Fee Income (not Other Income)
- Elyse ~$20K payments = Finders Fee (expense)
- PACE payments = Marketing (expense)
- FM Red Member LLC removed from tracked accounts
- Balance sheet: Assets (green box) split into Investments (left) and Loans Out + Deposits (right); Liabilities (red box) below
- XShore payments = Contractors category (not Other Operating)
- "Acquisition Fee Income" is a separate income category (🔑 icon)
- "Contractors" is a separate expense category (🔨 icon)
- Investment Contributions (pass-through and direct) are merged into one "Investment Contributions" bucket — drilldown shows individual wires with full descriptions
- Owner Distributions, Investment Contributions, Loans Out, Deposits, and Loan Paybacks are grouped under "Balance Sheet Transactions" card (not separate sections)
- Each investment contribution wire can be linked to a specific investment via `investment_id` on `exec_transactions` — dropdown in drilldown shows all investments + "Add New" option
- When adding a new investment from the wire linking dropdown, user enters name + ownership % → creates unlinked investment on balance sheet
- exec.html defaults to Monthly view, latest month selected
- URL hash state persistence: mode, period, drilldown type all saved to hash so page refresh keeps your view
- Browser back button closes drilldown (uses History API pushState/popstate)
- Linked investments show subtle ↗ arrow icon (not "Linked" text badge) — clicking navigates to Property Financials module via `target="_top"` (breaks out of iframe)
- PM Fee Income and Payroll rows show NET values (display only — doesn't affect totals). PM Fee shows "Gross | Less payroll" sub-note. Payroll shows "Out | In" sub-note.
- 132-40 Metropolitan Ave: 7.47% ownership, $400K contributed, ~$1.12M NOI (2026, excl RET pass-throughs), ~$1.39M NOI (2027 per Morris), 6% cap rate, $15.085M mortgage. Position value ≈ $273K = ((NOI/cap) - mortgage) × equity%. 36,186 SF. Closed Jan 2026.
- 60-18 Metropolitan Ave: 20% ownership, 3,180 SF. Closed May 2024.
- 132-40 Metropolitan budget format is tenant-by-tenant (not GL summary) — parsed by aggregating income categories (Rent→4010, RET→4120, CAM→4110, Insurance Recovery→4130, W/S Recovery→4140) across all tenants, then mapping expenses to GL codes. Budget file: `data/2026 Budget/Metropolitan *.xlsx`
- Property photos stored in `assets/Property Photos/` — mapped by `PROP_PHOTOS` in exec-v2.js/exec.html (partial name match via `includes()`) and `FB_PHOTOS` in index.html (exact name match). Shown as thumbnails on investment cards when expanded and as card header images in Property Financials. Photos: 132-40 Metro Ave, 60-18 Metro, 61 South, 340 MK, Paramus Plaza, 1700 East Putnam, 575 Broadway. **IMPORTANT:** Photo paths with spaces must be URL-encoded (`Property%20Photos/132-40%20Metro%20Ave%20corner%20view.png`). When renaming a property, update FB_PHOTOS key to match (it uses exact match, not partial).
- RET (Real Estate Tax Recovery) is a pass-through — tenants reimburse RE tax, so it offsets the expense. Exclude from NOI calculations (GL 4120). Same principle for Insurance Recovery (4130) and W/S Recovery (4140) if material.
- SQL migrations should be run via the admin website (admin.firstmilecap.com → SQL Console), NOT via Supabase dashboard directly. Claude CAN and SHOULD run SQL itself using the browser (Chrome MCP tools) — navigate to localhost:8000/#sql or admin.firstmilecap.com/#sql, paste into textarea, click Run. Do NOT ask Morris to run SQL manually.
- Category dropdown in drilldowns is grouped into sections: 💰 Income, 📋 Expenses, 📊 Balance Sheet, 🔄 Other — uses `<optgroup>` with `buildCategoryOptions()` helper
- "Investor Contribution (Pass-Through)" removed from dropdown — everything merged into "Investment Contributions"
- Loan Out / Deposit drilldown rows have inline editable name field (persists to `category_name` column) + category dropdown
- Loan Payback transactions link to a specific Loan Out via `category_name` (stores the loan name). Payback amount is netted against the loan on the balance sheet. Loans at $0 net are hidden.
- Same-named Loan Out transactions are consolidated into a single entry on the balance sheet (e.g. 2 Kemble FCB wires → 1 combined line)
- Loans Out have edit pencil (✏️) for inline editing of name, amount, start date, and maturity date on the balance sheet
- Loan Out has two dates: Start Date (always required, defaults to transaction date) and Maturity Date (optional). Start date affects cash flow period — loans with start date before the current period are excluded from that period's cash flow.
- `loan_start_date` column on exec_transactions — set automatically when categorizing as Loan Out, editable via balance sheet edit pencil
- Revenue section has a property/investment filter dropdown — filters income rows to show revenue for a specific property/investment
- Property/Investment linking dropdowns deduplicate by checking `propertyId` on investments (skip investments already linked to a listed property) — not by name matching
- Investment Contributions drilldown rows have: investment linking dropdown (links to `investment_id` on exec_transactions) + category dropdown
- Payroll double-counting fix: PM fee bank records are already net (not gross), so split logic only tracks `payrollSplitTotal` for display-only netting — does NOT reduce income amount
- `payrollSplits` map matches KNOWN_PAYROLL_SPLITS_BY_AMOUNT (txnAmount → splitAmount) after data loads via `matchPayrollSplits()`
- exec.html is loaded inside an iframe in index.html — links need `target="_top"` to break out
- NOI flows from index.html → exec.html iframe via `postMessage({ type: 'propertyNOI', data: noiMap })`
- Balance sheet investment valuation: `(NOI / cap_rate%) × equity%` for property-linked investments
- `FB_PROP_META` in index.html maps property IDs to names for Property Financials module
- Hash param `#financials&prop=PropertyName` auto-navigates to that property in index.html
- **Investment close dates** (in exec_investments.close_date): 1700 East Putnam 7/1/21, 61 South Paramus 12/28/23, 60-18 Metropolitan Ave 5/10/24, Paramus Plaza 6/28/24, FM 340 Kemble 1/21/25, 575 Broadway 8/1/25, 132-40 Metropolitan Ave 1/1/26. Investments sorted newest-first by close date on both exec-v2 balance sheet and Property Financials cards.
- **Property Financials cards** (fbRenderCards in index.html): show photo, close date ("Closed Mon YYYY"), Revenue/Expenses/NOI, SF, NOI/SF, Exp Ratio. Close dates fetched from exec_investments at load time. Sorted by close date (newest first).
- **CSS scoping pitfall:** index.html defines `.bs-card-title` with `border-bottom:1px solid; padding:12px 16px` for Property Financials balance sheet. Since exec-v2 renders INSIDE index.html (not iframe), these styles leak into exec-v2 investment cards. Fix: scope exec-v2 card styles under `#exec2Root` and explicitly reset `border-bottom:none; padding:0;` on `.bs-card-title`.
- **`</script>` in template literals:** NEVER put literal `</script>` inside a JS template string within a `<script>` tag — the HTML parser sees it as the closing tag and truncates the file. This was root cause of exec-v2 launch bugs.
- **exec-v2 init sequence:** `_injectCSS()` → `_injectHTML()` → `_initNOI()` → `initDashboard()`. All must happen in this order. Auto-init at bottom of IIFE detects if view is already active when script loads (handles script-load-after-switchView race).
- **1700 East Putnam and 575 Broadway** were added to exec_investments on 2026-03-30 (previously only in properties table, not tracked as investments). Both have ownership_pct=0 and valuation=0 — Morris needs to fill in actual values.

## Preferences
- Morris works fast — keep things concise, skip unnecessary explanation
- Commit to git regularly; config.js is gitignored for secrets
- CLAUDE.md should be kept in git (not gitignored) so it syncs across laptops
- When testing integrations, just do it — don't over-ask for confirmation on dev/test actions
- Claude should proactively update CLAUDE.md with business logic, decisions, and context that wouldn't be obvious from reading the codebase alone — no need to ask permission each time
- ALL decisions, feature specs, and business logic MUST be written to CLAUDE.md immediately — don't rely on conversation memory across sessions
- Run SQL queries via the admin website's built-in tools, not the Supabase dashboard
