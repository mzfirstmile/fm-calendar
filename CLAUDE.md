# First Mile Capital — AI Admin Platform

## Owner
Morris Zeitouni (mz@firstmilecap.com) — Managing Partner, First Mile Capital

## What This Is
An internal admin dashboard for First Mile Capital, a real estate investment firm. The app is hosted at admin.firstmilecap.com (GitHub Pages) and uses Supabase as the backend + Claude as an AI assistant embedded in the UI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Single-page HTML/JS app (index.html = main admin dashboard, exec.html = executive view)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth)
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic) — embedded chat widget with tool use
- **Email:** Microsoft Graph API via Supabase Edge Functions (aiassistant@firstmilecap.com)
- **SMS:** Telnyx API via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (CNAME: admin.firstmilecap.com)
- **Auth/Identity:** Azure AD (tenant: bb09c9a4-2028-4b30-bdbc-dc9c623a2398, app: 3a5ad401-67c5-4632-993f-2b4051bd6bf1) — DO NOT put secrets here; they live in config.js which is gitignored

## Business Logic & Domain Knowledge
*(Things that live in Morris's head, not in the code — add here as we learn them)*
- Payroll reimbursements are structured as deductions to the property management fee (not separate line items)
- AM Partner Payouts (~$4,333/mo from FM Paramus Member account) are deductions against Asset Management Fee Income, not separate distributions — shown as "Less: AM Partner Payout" in the AM Fee drilldown
- Email auto-reply is instant via Graph webhook (email-webhook) with 5-min cron fallback (check-inbox); dedup via atomic `replied_at` lock in auto-reply function
- Graph webhook subscription (subscribe-inbox) expires every 3 days — needs daily cron renewal
- "Deposit" category = balance sheet asset (not operating expense), tracked separately like Loan Out
- "Loan Out" category = balance sheet asset, user assigns a friendly name (e.g. "Wooster loan to Ricky") shown on balance sheet instead of bank description
- JLL CAS credits = Asset Management Fee Income (not Other Income)
- Elyse ~$20K payments = Finders Fee (expense)
- Balance sheet: Assets (green box) split into Investments (left) and Loans Out + Deposits (right); Liabilities (red box) below

## Preferences
- Morris works fast — keep things concise, skip unnecessary explanation
- Commit to git regularly; config.js is gitignored for secrets
- CLAUDE.md should be kept in git (not gitignored) so it syncs across laptops
- When testing integrations, just do it — don't over-ask for confirmation on dev/test actions
- Claude should proactively update CLAUDE.md with business logic, decisions, and context that wouldn't be obvious from reading the codebase alone — no need to ask permission each time
